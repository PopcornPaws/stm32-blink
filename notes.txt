== System Clocks ==

AHB  - Advanced High Performance Bus (168 MHz)
ABP1 - Low Speed Advanced Peripheral Bus (42 MHz)
ABP2 - High Speed Advanced Peripheral Bus (84 MHz)

These are controlled by the RCC - Reset and Clock Control module

== Port pin modes ==

Digital input / output
Analog input / output
Alternate

Input -> Float, pull up, pull down
Output -> Open drain (OD)

== Typical GPIO settings ==

Peripheral ===== Config ===== Mode ===== Pull
LED              OUT (2MHz)   PP        pull-up and down
BUTTON           IN (2MHz)    --        pull-down
ADC              IN (analog)  --        no pull, select proper speed
USART            AF (50MHz)   PP        pull-up
SPI              AF (50MHz)   PP        pull-up
I2C              AF (50MHz)   OD        no-pull
USB              AF (50MHz)   PP        no-pull
CAN              AF9 (2MHz)   PP        no-pull
